## Synopsis

A chrome extension for WaterlooWorks (University of Waterloo's co-op site).

You can access the extension at:
[WaterlooWorks](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/waterlooworks/ldhmcfigggabofhhiicdkammlmlgcjhl)

## What is it:
This extension modifies the Application table on WaterlooWorks and shows you the real your real number of rejected applications. Currently,
WaterlooWorks shows an incorrect number for rejected applications on the Application table. This is because employers are able to select
interviewees and not explicitly reject other applicants. This results in rejected applications being shown as still valid.

This extension show the real count for remaining, selected, and rejected applications on WaterlooWork's application table. This extension
also enables you to mark rows on the application table.

## Getting Started:
Add the extension to chrome. And voila. You can now see your real number of rejected applications

## Motivation:
I was annoyed that WaterlooWorks did not show me the real count for my rejected applications.

## Soon to Come:
WaterlooWorks is a relatively new web app. Whenever, I want a new feature to implemented, I will add it to this chrome extension.
